TFTP
====

TFTP stands for Trivial File Transfer Protocol and is most memorable for it's simplicity, for every individual packet the server sends or waits an acknowledgement, if it doesn't receive one it continues to retransmit until one arrives. This project was built during my time at the University of Miami as part of CSC524 - Computer Networks. The project provides a basic netbounce client and the  TFTP server that only allows GET/PUT to the current working directory.
